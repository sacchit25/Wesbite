            <p> Every year Qatar Tennis Federation hosts the ATP and WTA tournaments where top-ranked 
                players participate. I (on the right) was part of the officiating team which oversaw matches of the likes 
                of Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. This experience helped me understand the minute details 
                that make an international tournament a success - details often looked down on by an outsider. 
                Furthermore, it provided me a platform where I could bolster my professionalism and discipline. </p>

                <p> Being an active person, staying closed within four walls was a completely different challenge. 
                    To make the most out of my time in the pandemic, I decided to launch my YouTube channel as a 
                    distraction to the outside world. Over the course of my 3 months on YouTube, I gained over 150 
                    subscribers and 4,000 views. Through this, I enhanced my editing skills and also learned ways to 
                    communicate and market myself to unfamiliar people sharing similar interests.</p>
