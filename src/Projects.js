        <p> Finding internships in the STEM field especially Computer Science is a very common 
            struggle among students. Driven by this, me and a group of other students are building a 
            project for the same to ease the internship process as we believe that being an intern is 
            an exciting and learning process and not a struggle.  </p>

        <p> Because who does not like memes! Self learned React over the summer and build my first
            react project as a capstone project for a Scrimba Course on React. (Some memes may be
            better than the other)

            Having done my first year remote, I feel I lacked the opportunity to meet new people and broaden
            my understanding of different cultures. Entering into the US during my second year will prove to 
            be challenging due to lack of connections with my batchmates. Driven by this me and my friend decided 
            to come up with an idea of overcoming this with the use of technology. This project can help people in 
            finding new connections with similar interests. The algorithm outputs possible people you could meet by 
            comparing different aspects like courses taken, favorite cuisine/hobby/music genre.
